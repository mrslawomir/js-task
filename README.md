# js-task
Code and review of the task number 2. (http://jsfiddle.net/fzuhs3b1/3/)
## task2-v1
Failed initial approach.
## task2-v2
Non-working code created during the meeting.  
Used for review, commenting and debugging the problem.
## task2-v3-final
**The actual working code**  
Reworked and improved approach based on observations from v1 & v2
## task2-v4-extra
Bonus, just for fun.  
Works around the issue of modifying the base Array type (while bending the rules of the task by modifying the disallowed section)
