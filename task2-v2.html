          *Note* - since we start from a known "start" value index, the following if() will always evaluate to false. While it might seem
          as a waste, this only occurs once and construct is both simple and readable, so it seems worth the tradeoff.

          *Note* - the following check should test if we can locate a matching "end" value for the currently found "start". While simple, it's not a good approach:
          - we already know that the "start" value is present, so the "startIndex === -1" check is redundant
          - if a matching end value can't be found, it means that any further iterations of this loop won't result in a matching range
          A more suitable soution would be:
          if(endIndex === -1) break;

          /*
          If no ranges have been found (result array empty) or if the range found in previous iterations is longer than what has been found now, 
          we replace the result with the new, shorter array.

          *Note* - the "result = frag" assignment causes a TypeError, as the "result" array has been mistakenly declared as a const. 
          The invocation of the getRange method is wrapped in a try/catch statement without an error handler, which obfuscated the issue and could only be observed
          with the use of the debugger.
          Solutions:
          - declare the variable using let/var keyword:
          let result = []
          - instead of assigning the value directly, change the elements inside the array, which is not blocked via a "const" declaration:
          if(result.length == 0 || (result.length > frag.length) ) result.splice(0, result.length, ...frag)
          */          
        }
        return result;
